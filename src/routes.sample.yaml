# Configuration for Proxy Routing with Access Control

# The upstreams section lists all the remote services you want to proxy.
# Each upstream has its own set of URIs with associated access rules.
upstreams:
  # The 'url' is the address of the remote service you want to proxy to.
  # Optionally, you can provide a 'slug', which acts as a unique identifier for this upstream.
  # If you don't provide a 'slug', one will be auto-generated from the URL.
  - url: "https://httpbin.org"
    #slug: "first-service" # This is an optional identifier for your service.

    # Under 'uris', you define rules for specific paths of this upstream.
    # You specify the path, the HTTP methods, and the allowed roles/users.
    uris:
      "/anything/test": # Path you want to secure.
        methods: # HTTP methods this rule applies to. If omitted, all methods are allowed.
          - GET
        roles: # Roles that are allowed to access this path.
          - admin_staff
        users: # Specific users allowed. This has priority over roles.
          - bender@planetexpress.com

      "/stream/*": # You can use wildcards to cover multiple paths.
        methods:
          - GET
        roles:
          - admin_staff

  # Here's another upstream example with an explicit slug.
  - url: "https://ipleak.net"
    slug: "ip"
    uris:
      "/*": # This URI is open to any authenticated user, as neither 'roles' nor 'users' are specified.
        methods:
          - GET
          - POST

  - url: "http://localhost:3000"
    slug: "martin"
    uris:
      "/*": # This URI is open to any authenticated user, as neither 'roles' nor 'users' are specified.
        methods:
          - GET
          - POST
        roles:
          - admin_staff
          - ship_staff
# Make sure to always keep this configuration secure!
# Unauthorized access or changes to this configuration can compromise your service's security.
